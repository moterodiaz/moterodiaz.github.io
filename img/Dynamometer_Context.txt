 I.​ Theoretical Analysis and Circuit Aspects
        Our chosen sensor is a string gauge, a mechanism that changes resistance based on the
strain applied on two micro-thin wires within the gauge. Its transfer equation can be defined
as the following:


                                              ∆𝑅        ∆𝐿
                                               𝑅
                                                   = 𝐺𝐹 𝐿
                                             ∆𝑅             ∆𝐿
                                            120Ω
                                                   = 2. 1 𝐿
                                                            ∆𝐿
                                            ∆𝑅 = 252        𝐿



        where GF is the gauge factor (it is 2.1 for our sensors), R is the starting resistance of
the strain gauge (120 Ω in our case), ∆R is the change in resistance, ∆L is the local change in
the length of the material, and L is the initial unstretched length. The ratio of lengths is
known as the mechanical strain. Since strain is usually quite small, the change in resistance is
also quite small. Strain is a normalized measure of how much the material deforms.


        We will be computing the colloquially named “grip” which is applied to our
mechanical device through the strain felt by the gauge when the device undergoes pressure.
To actually connect our voltage change to the strain applied, we will use the circuit, shown in
figure 2, where the only dynamically variable component is the string gauge. In other terms,
when the pressure is applied to our mechanism and the string gauge undergoes strain, the
resistor value within our circuit will change, consequently affecting the output voltage value
we measure. Our transfer equation can be boiled down to the following equation:


                              Equation 1: 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 𝑉𝑟𝑒𝑓 + 𝐺(𝑉+ − 𝑉− )
        In the above expression Vout is the voltage on pin 6, V+ is the voltage on pin 3, V- is
the voltage on pin 2, and Vref is the voltage on pin 5. Note that Vref is set to 2.5V in our
experiment. When we measure Vout relative to Vref , we can measure the change in voltage
caused by the beam being bent up or down. In turn, G can be computed through:


                                                                    10 000 Ω
                                    Equation 2: 𝐺 = 1 +                𝑅𝐹




        G is the gain in this situation and is completely dependent on the value of RF, where
RF is the value of the reference resistor between pins 1 and 8 shown in figure 1. Our gain is
equal to 501 due to the fact that our chosen reference resistance is 200 Ohms, as shown in
figure 2.




     ​        Figure 1: The pins allocation and circuit diagram for the AD623 chip used.
         We should then first compute what our V+ and V- should be:


                 ​       𝑉+ = 𝑉𝑖𝑛 − 𝐼𝑆𝐺𝑅𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝑆𝐺 | 𝑉− = 𝑉𝑖𝑛 − 𝐼𝑅𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙


​       Where RTotal - SG and ISG are the current and total resistance of the wheatstone bridge
leg that includes the string gauge. Additionally RTotal and I are the current and total resistance
of the other wheatstone bridge leg. We can then individually compute these values


                     𝑅𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝑆𝐺 = ( 120 + ∆𝑅 + 115 + 10)Ω | 𝑅𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 242 Ω


                                                  5𝑉                  5𝑉
                                     𝐼𝑆𝐺 =     𝑅𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝑆𝐺
                                                             |𝐼 =    𝑅𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙




​        We can then compute both legs of equation 4:


                                              120
                           𝑉+ = 5(1 + 225 + ∆𝑅 ) 𝑉 | 𝑉− = 2. 5 𝑉
​      Finally, by inserting both of these values into equation 2, we can determine a transfer
equation between the output voltage from the circuit and the strain the string gauge
undergoes:
                                                       120
                    𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 2. 5 𝑉 + 501(5(1 + 225 + ∆𝑅 ) 𝑉 − 2. 5 𝑉)
                                                       300 600 𝑉
                               𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 = 1251 𝑉 −                   ∆𝐿
                                                     225 + 252    𝐿




​      We will later relate the strain and input force through a transfer equation tailored to
the geometry and specific situation of our mechanism.

II.​ Circuit Description

 1.​   Wheatstone Bridge:
         The strain gauge is placed in one leg of a Wheatstone bridge, along with two fixed
121 Ω resistors and two additional balancing resistors (115 Ω and 10 Ω). When no strain is
applied, the bridge is close to balanced and the output is close to zero. When the strain gauge
is stretched or compressed, its resistance changes slightly, creating a small voltage difference
across the bridge.


 2.​   Instrumentation Amplifier (AD263):
        The small voltage difference from the bridge is amplified using an AD623
instrumentation amplifier. The gain is set by a 200 Ω resistor between pins 1 and 8. This
boosts the signal so small changes in strain create noticeable changes in output voltage. The
reference pin (V_ref) is connected to 2.5V to center the output signal around 2.5V, allowing
us to measure both positive and negative changes.


 3.​   Input Filter:
       A 10 nF capacitor is placed across the amplifier's differential inputs. This acts as a
low-pass filter to reduce high-frequency noise before amplification.


 4.​   Output Filter:
       After the amplifier, the signal passes through a 5 kΩ resistor and a 100 μF capacitor,
forming a second low-pass filter. This smooths the output voltage and helps eliminate noise,
giving a clean and stable signal for data collection.
III.​ Bode Plot
        The circuit is tuned for accurate, low-noise strain measurement. The Wheatstone
bridge provides a sensitive means of detecting resistance changes, the AD623 amplifier offers
high gain with a stable reference offset, and the input and output filters collectively suppress
unwanted noise. The chosen component values and filter characteristics reflect a design
optimized for stable, low-frequency strain monitoring. These aspects can be observed in
figure 4.




   Figure 4: Bode plot of the gain and phase of our circuit with the 200-ohm gain resistor
 removed. A cut-off frequency of 0.318 Hertz can be observed as the inflection point for the
                                 steady decrease of the gain.
IV.​ Data Analysis
       To convert the voltage signal into physical force measurements, a calibration
procedure is performed. Known masses are applied to the sensor and corresponding output
voltages are recorded. These masses are converted into force in newtons using the equation.

                                   𝐹=   (    𝑚
                                            1000   ) · 9. 80665
where m is the mass in grams. A linear regression is then performed on the resulting (voltage,
force) data pairs to establish an empirical relationship of the form:
                                        𝐹 = 𝑎𝑉 + 𝑏


       However, the sensor is positioned at a 45-degree angle relative to the direction of
applied force. Because strain gauges measure the normal component of strain, the measured
                                                              2   ◦
strain is related to the actual axial strain by a factor of 𝑐𝑜𝑠 (45 ) = 0. 5. Therefore, to
compute the true axial force, the force computed from the calibration curve must be corrected
by a factor of two:
                                       𝐹 = 2(𝑎𝑉 + 𝑏)


         This final equation provides a direct conversion from the measured output voltage to
the true applied grip force. It incorporates both the calibration-derived linear model and the
geometric correction due to sensor orientation, ensuring the resulting force values accurately
reflect the mechanical input to the system. The calibrations curves can be seen in figure 5:

V.​ Final Measurements and Evaluations




 Figure 6: The direct output from Matlab script where the voltage measured was inputted to
                                    calculate the force.

        Using the described system, a female volunteer was asked to exert grip force on the
mechanism. The measured output voltage was 2.92 V. Substituting this value into the final
force equation resulted in a computed grip force of around 277.4 N. According to published
ergonomic data, the average grip strength for females is approximately 292 N. Given the
inherent biological variability and potential slight measurement offsets, our result falls well
within a reasonable and expected range. This supports both the reliability of our sensor
calibration and the accuracy of our instrumentation design.

        In conclusion, the sensor system accurately measured grip strength through a
well-designed circuit that carefully considered gain, frequency response, and calibration. The
output values demonstrate the device’s effectiveness in converting small strains into usable,
reliable physical measurements.
