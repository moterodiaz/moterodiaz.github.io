Who are we?
                    What is Solar Sailing?
● Uses photons’ momentum by reﬂecting them off a surface
    ○ Like a sailboat but with light instead of wind
● Sail size is directly proportional to the thrust generated
    ○ Bigger is better!
              Overview Of Mission

● Apply and demonstrate the
  feasibility of solar sail propulsion.
● Innovate deployment procedure for
  the sails.
● Demonstrate the feasibility of High
  Gain Antenna (HGA) sail.
                             Concept of Operations
Phase 1: Launch
Satellite is launched into
Low Earth Orbit
                                                     Phase 4: High Gain Antenna Testing
Phase 2: Deployment                                  Satellite begins operating its HGA
Satellite detumbles and
deploys its sail
                                                        Phase 5: End of Life
                                                        Satellite will either turn
Phase 3: Orbit Raising
                                                        sail to fall into Earth’s

     SolarSURFER Module Design
●   Dedicated 4U volume for solar sail.

     ○     Actual volume will be approximately 200cm3 less due to deployment systems, electrical

           wiring, fasteners, and detonators.

●   1U of the remaining 2U will be utilized for “life essentials”.

     ○     Battery pack, OBC, ADCS kit, transceivers

●   Last 1U will house scientiﬁc instrumentation.

     ○     Hyperspectral imaging sensors, ﬁber-optic cabling,

●   Tuna-can pod volume 1 will be utilized for horn extension mechanism (3 nitinol wires)

●   Tuna-can pod volume 2 will be utilized for a 9cm lens for hyperspectral imaging

                               Average Operations
●   SolarSURFER uses the ADCS system to
    orient the cubesat towards the
    observation target
●   Hyperspectral Imaging takes pictures of
    the surface
●   SolarSURFER reorients itself towards the
    sun to continue propulsion
●   Over JHU we downlink our collected data
     ○    Battery Health and Charge
     ○    Photos
     ○    IMU Data
     ○    Orientation Data
●   We uplink commands and analyse data
●   Repeat!
                                Sail Experiments
Sail Composition
 ●   What is the reﬂectivity and emissivity of our
     material?
 ●   What’s the best layer conﬁguration?
Communications
 ●   How does folding the sail affect signal strength?
 ●   Test different reﬂectarray shapes and sizes
Deployment
 ●   How do we extend the sail?
                   Material Selection
● Backbone: CP1 or Kapton ﬁlms
  ○ Optimal thermal stability, tensile strength, and resistance to
     UV radiation and atomic oxygen
            Folding Techniques Overview
● Miura-Ori Fold: A
  single-degree-of-freedom
  pattern, allowing rapid and
  reliable deployment with
  high packing efficiency.
● Box Pleated Fold: A rigid
                                Miura-Ori Fold (top)   Box Pleated (below)
  and structured fold,
  distributing stress evenly
  and providing better
  material control during
  deployment.
                                      Deployment                 This is the Cubesat
●   20m x 20m Sail needs to be unfurled from the 4U

    compartment

●   Deployment will be carried out through a backbone of SMA

●   Booms will be initially deployed through Induction Heating

    through a PWM circuit

●   Passive heating from Sun prevents booms from losing their

    shape
                        Sail High Gain Antenna
●   Sail will be ﬁtted with an array of patches to create a reﬂectarray
●   Building on previous reﬂectarray designs, we seek to build a ﬂexible one
●   Array simulation on HFSS dictates a concentric pattern
                        Sail High Gain Antenna
●   Normal horn design requires too much heating and deployment
●   Reﬂector design allows for everything to ﬁt in the 6U form factor
●   Horn can be minimized saving space
●   Reﬂector is deployed and adjusted by a nitinol network
